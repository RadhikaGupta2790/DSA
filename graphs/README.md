**NOTE:**

Directed, undirected, connected, disconnected, acyclic, and cyclic are terms used to describe different properties of graphs in graph theory. Let's define each term:

**Directed Graph (or Digraph):**
A graph in which edges have a direction.
Each edge has an orientation, going from one vertex (node) to another.
Edges are represented as ordered pairs (u, v), indicating a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v.

**Undirected Graph:**
A graph in which edges have no direction.
Edges are represented as unordered pairs {u, v}, indicating an undirected edge between vertex u and vertex v.

**Connected Graph:**
A graph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices.
All vertices are reachable from every other vertex by traversing edges.

**Disconnected Graph:**
A graph that is not connected.
It consists of two or more disconnected components, where each component is a connected subgraph.

**Acyclic Graph:**
A graph that has no cycles (i.e., no closed loops or circuits).
A tree is a common example of an acyclic graph.

**Cyclic Graph:**
A graph that contains at least one cycle.
A cycle is a closed path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

**In summary:**
A graph can be directed or undirected based on the presence or absence of edge directions.
A graph can be connected or disconnected based on whether there is a path between every pair of vertices.
A graph can be acyclic or cyclic based on whether it contains cycles.
These properties help classify and understand the structure and behavior of different types of graphs.
